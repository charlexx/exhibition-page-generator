  "subtitle": "An exploration of light, shadow, and the spaces between",
  "description": "Luminous Depths brings together five contemporary artists whose work interrogates the boundaries between the visible and the unseen. Through painting, sculpture, and installation, these artists invite viewers to consider how light shapes our perception of space, memory, and emotion.\n\nThis exhibition marks the first time these artists have shown together, creating a dialogue that spans continents and artistic traditions. Each work responds to the gallery's unique architecture, transforming familiar spaces into realms of contemplation and wonder.",
